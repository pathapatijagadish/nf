I have a client's requirements. Can you please check the same and let me have your inputs

-- Project brief --

Create an online tool in Ruby on Rails that allows a user to upload a PDF template (see attached file - test-form.pdf) and a CSV spreadsheet (see attached file - dummy-data-final.csv) and then the site produces a zipped file containing the mail-merged values in multiple PDF files. The front end will use the Zurb Foundation 5 CSS framework.

Functionality to include the following:

* Upload PDF template with form fields
* Upload CSV or XLS file containing data columns to map to form fields
* Specify a file output naming convention using CSV data eg. {id}_file.pdf
* Zip files for delivery
* Produce download link
* Use CSS Framework - Foundation 5
* Allow a test file to be generated from the uploaded docs before final merge
* Heroku webserver (my account)
* Codebase to be managed in Github
